  <p>Hello, I’m Ayush Maurya.</p>

<p>
I’m a computer science student with a strong interest in software development,
problem-solving, and understanding how systems work under the hood.
<strong>Hexon Dev</strong> is my personal space where I document what I learn, build,
and figure out along the way.
</p>

<p>
I believe learning works best when concepts are broken down clearly and applied
practically. Whether it’s programming, data structures, operating systems, or
web development, I focus on fundamentals rather than shortcuts.
</p>

<p>
This blog is not about pretending to know everything. It’s about learning in
public, sharing clear explanations, and keeping track of progress over time.
Some posts may be technical, some reflective, and some purely experimental.
</p>

<p>
If you’re a student or beginner navigating the same path, I hope you find
something here that helps—or at least makes the journey feel a little less
confusing.
</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
